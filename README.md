    git@github.com:xcompany/x-Managment.git [ssh]
    https://github.com/xcompany/x-Managment.git.git [https]

After copy that 🔗, go to the os terminal create a directory or directly clone the 🔗.

    :git clone <git@github.com:xcompany/repo_name.git>

Then go to the directory

    : cd x-Managment
    : code .

### clone a branch of a repository

    : git clone -b <branch_name> git@gitlab.com:sourav.majumder/repo_name.git

# Git Command

### Stages changes in the all files for the next commit.

    git add .

### Check status of your working directory, showing changes that are staged or unstaged.

    git status

### Records the staged changes as a new commit along with a descriptive message.

    git commit -m "<message>" (-m means message)

### Uploads local commits to a remote repository.

    git push -u origin <branch_name>

### Create a new branch & switch to the branch.

    git checkout -b <branch_name>

    git checkout <branch-name>

### Switch to a existed branch after commit in current branch

    git switch <branch_name>

### To check the current branch you are on in a Git repository using the command line.

    git branch

Then git will display a list of all the branches in your repository. The currently checked-out branch will be highlighted with an asterisk (\*).
For example, if you see output like this:

    main
    *feature-branch

It means that you are currently on the "feature-branch" because it has the asterisk next to it.

### Only want to see the current branch.

    git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD

### To switch to a different branch in a Git repository using the command line.

    git checkout <branch-name>

### Fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into the current branch.

    git pull origin <branch_name>

### Rename branch name.

    git branch -m <old_branch_name> <new_branch_name>

### Delete a branch.

At first switch to other branch(not delete branch) then delete the branch you want to delete.

    git branch -d <branch-name>

### Delete the .git Directory:

If you want to remove Git version control from a project, you essentially need to delete the hidden .git directory in the root of your project. This will remove all Git-related history, configuration, and tracking from the project.

    rm -rf .git

### Remove an existed git repositoy & add a new repository to the project

    git remote remove origin

    git remote add origin <origin_name>  or
    git remote set-url origin <origin_name>

check the origin

    git remote -v
    git branch
    git push -u origin <branch_name>  or
    git push -f origin <brach_name>

### To clear the cache and update the ignored files :

syntex :

    git rm --cached <file name>

example :

    git rm --cached .env
    git rm --cached serviceAccountKey.json
    git rm -r --cached __pycache__

    git commit -m "Update .gitignore to exclude serviceAccountKey.json"

    git push -u origin <branch_name>
